# Project 1: Drive Game

A C# console game based on driving and avoiding obstacles as you aim to get the highest score.

## Technologies Used

In building this game, I used basic C# tools such as 2D arryas, For loops and nested for loops, Switch statement, Console.Key and many more.

### A code snippet from the project:

```

 static void initializeScene()
        {
            const int roadWidth = 10;                           // Set width of the road (drivable area) make it a const so it never changes
            gameRunning = true;                                 // Set game state to running
            carPosition = width / 2;                            // Place car in center of screen
            carVelocity = 0;                                    // Car starts with no movement
            score = 0;                                          // Reset score to zero
            previousRoadUpdate = 0;                             // Reset road curve direction
            int leftSide = (width - roadWidth) / 2;             // Calculate left edge of road
            int rightSide = leftSide + roadWidth + 1;           // Calculate right edge of road
            road = new char[height, width];                     // Create 2D array for game area consisting of a row and a column
            for (int i = 0; i < height; i++)                    // Loop through each row
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < width; j++)                 // Loop through each column
                {
                    if (j < leftSide || j > rightSide)          // If outside road boundaries
                    {
                        road[i, j] = '.';                       // Add grass/off-road (dot)
                    }
                    else                                        // If inside road boundaries
                    {
                        road[i, j] = ' ';                       // Add road surface (emptyspace)
                    }
                }
            }
        }

```

## What I Learned:

- I learned to better use 2D arrays
- I polished my use of the switch statement
- I learned to use the Console.Key in making my charater move

# Project 2: Multiple Gaming Menu

In this project, it was focused on making a interactive menu where five games can be selected and played based on the users preference.

## Technologiy used

For this project, the main focus was on functions and a switch statement. Most of these functions where void functions and had no return values.

## Code Snippet:

`static void dollargame()
{
bool playagain = true;
double quarter, penny, nickel, dime;
double numofquarter, numofpenny, numofnickel, numofdime;
double onedollar, totalvalue, overone, underone;
while (playagain)
{
onedollar = 1.00;
quarter = 0.25;
penny = 0.01;
nickel = 0.05;
dime = 0.10;
bool win = false;
int turns = 0;

        while (!win)

        {
            turns++;

            Console.WriteLine("Guess The amount of Pennies, Nickels, Dimes and Quarters needed to make a Dollar($1)");
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of Quarter(s)");
            numofquarter = validinput();
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of Dime(s)");
            numofdime = validinput();
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of Nickel(s)");
            numofnickel = validinput();
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of Pennies");
            numofpenny = validinput();

            totalvalue = ((numofquarter * quarter) + (numofpenny * penny) + (numofdime * dime) + (numofnickel * nickel));
            totalvalue = Math.Round(totalvalue, 2);

            if (totalvalue == onedollar)

            {
                Console.WriteLine("Congratulations!!!! You got it right. It took you " + turns + " to complete the game!");
                break;
            }
            else if (totalvalue > onedollar)
            {

                overone = totalvalue - onedollar;
                Console.WriteLine(+totalvalue + " Damn !!! You were over by " + overone);
                break;

            }
            else
            {
                underone = onedollar - totalvalue;
                Console.WriteLine("Tough Luck!! You were under by " + underone);
                break;
            }

        }
        Console.WriteLine();                        //ask the user to play again//
                                                    // Console.WriteLine("---Do you want to play again?---");
                                                    // string response = Console.ReadLine();

        // if (response != "Yes" && response != "yes")
        // {
        //  playagain = false;
        // }
        playagain = yesorno();

        //Console.ReadKey();
        Console.Clear();
    }

    Console.WriteLine("Thank you for Playing!");
    Console.ReadKey();
    Console.Clear();

}`

## What i learned(Short Reflection)

- I learned to use the modulo (%) during this project.
- I learned to properly do an input validation using try.Parse
- I learned to use a swich case for my menu selection and link that the 5 functions which served as mini games
