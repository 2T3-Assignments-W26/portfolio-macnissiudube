# Project 1: Drive Game

A C# console game based on driving and avoiding obstacles as you aim to get the highest score.

## Technologies Used

In building this game, I used basic C# tools such as 2D arryas, For loops and nested for loops, Switch statement, Console.Key and many more.

### A code snippet from the project:

`static void handleInput()
{
while (Console.KeyAvailable)
{
ConsoleKey key = Console.ReadKey(true).Key;
if (key == ConsoleKey.A || key == ConsoleKey.LeftArrow)
{
carVelocity = -1;
}
else if (key == ConsoleKey.D || key == ConsoleKey.RightArrow)
{
carVelocity = +1;
}
else if (key == ConsoleKey.W || key == ConsoleKey.UpArrow || key == ConsoleKey.S || key == ConsoleKey.DownArrow)
{
carVelocity = 0;
}
else if (key == ConsoleKey.Escape)
{
gameRunning = false;
keepPlaying = false;
}
else if (key == ConsoleKey.Enter)
{
Console.ReadLine();
}
}
}`

## What I Learned:

- I learned to better use 2D arrays
- I polished my use of the switch statement
- I learned to use the Console.Key in making my charater move

# Project 2: Multiple Gaming Menu

In this project, it was focused on making a interactive menu where five games can be selected and played based on the users preference.

## Technologiy used

For this project, the main focus was on functions and a switch statement. Most of these functions where void functions and had no return values.

## Code Snippet:

`static void dollargame()
{
bool playagain = true;
double quarter, penny, nickel, dime;
double numofquarter, numofpenny, numofnickel, numofdime;
double onedollar, totalvalue, overone, underone;
while (playagain)
{
onedollar = 1.00;
quarter = 0.25;
penny = 0.01;
nickel = 0.05;
dime = 0.10;
bool win = false;
int turns = 0;

        while (!win)

        {
            turns++;

            Console.WriteLine("Guess The amount of Pennies, Nickels, Dimes and Quarters needed to make a Dollar($1)");
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of Quarter(s)");
            numofquarter = validinput();
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of Dime(s)");
            numofdime = validinput();
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of Nickel(s)");
            numofnickel = validinput();
            Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of Pennies");
            numofpenny = validinput();

            totalvalue = ((numofquarter * quarter) + (numofpenny * penny) + (numofdime * dime) + (numofnickel * nickel));
            totalvalue = Math.Round(totalvalue, 2);

            if (totalvalue == onedollar)

            {
                Console.WriteLine("Congratulations!!!! You got it right. It took you " + turns + " to complete the game!");
                break;
            }
            else if (totalvalue > onedollar)
            {

                overone = totalvalue - onedollar;
                Console.WriteLine(+totalvalue + " Damn !!! You were over by " + overone);
                break;

            }
            else
            {
                underone = onedollar - totalvalue;
                Console.WriteLine("Tough Luck!! You were under by " + underone);
                break;
            }

        }
        Console.WriteLine();                        //ask the user to play again//
                                                    // Console.WriteLine("---Do you want to play again?---");
                                                    // string response = Console.ReadLine();

        // if (response != "Yes" && response != "yes")
        // {
        //  playagain = false;
        // }
        playagain = yesorno();

        //Console.ReadKey();
        Console.Clear();
    }

    Console.WriteLine("Thank you for Playing!");
    Console.ReadKey();
    Console.Clear();

}`

## What i learned(Short Reflection)

- I learned to use the modulo (%) during this project.
- I learned to properly do an input validation using try.Parse
- I learned to use a swich case for my menu selection and link that the 5 functions which served as mini games
