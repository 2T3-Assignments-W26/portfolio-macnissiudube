# Project 1: Drive Game

A C# console game based on driving and avoiding obstacles as you aim to get the highest score.

## Technologies Used

In building this game, I used basic C# tools such as 2D arryas, For loops and nested for loops, Switch statement, Console.Key and many more.

### A code snippet from the project:

`static void handleInput()
{
while (Console.KeyAvailable)
{
ConsoleKey key = Console.ReadKey(true).Key;
if (key == ConsoleKey.A || key == ConsoleKey.LeftArrow)
{
carVelocity = -1;
}
else if (key == ConsoleKey.D || key == ConsoleKey.RightArrow)
{
carVelocity = +1;
}
else if (key == ConsoleKey.W || key == ConsoleKey.UpArrow || key == ConsoleKey.S || key == ConsoleKey.DownArrow)
{
carVelocity = 0;
}
else if (key == ConsoleKey.Escape)
{
gameRunning = false;
keepPlaying = false;
}
else if (key == ConsoleKey.Enter)
{
Console.ReadLine();
}
}
}`

## What I Learned:

- I learned to better use 2D arrays
- I polished my use of the switch statement
- I learned to use the Console.Key in making my charater move

# Project 2: Multiple Gaming Menu

In this project, it was focused on making a interactive menu where  five games can be selected and played based on the users preference. 

## Technologiy used

For this project, the main focus was on functions and a switch statement. Most of these functions where void functions and had no return values.
